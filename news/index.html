                <p>The Chandrayaan series is significant to India’s space programme because it was the first to prove to
                    the world that we had tremendous potential. Even though we started out much later than other
                    space-faring countries — when our space programme began, the US and the USSR were already on the
                    verge of landing on the moon — it was the Chandrayaan 1 mission that confirmed the presence of water
                    molecules on the moon.
                    <br>
                    The world realised that India is in a position to provide insights, inputs, and inferences that
                    could be of utility to them as well for future missions. Today, we are equal partners. The
                    Chandrayaan-3 is going to give a quantum leap to India’s role in the global arena. The entire world
                    is watching — what we learn from this mission will be important for the global scientific community
                    at large.

                <p>The United States and China will look to revive efforts to combat global warming this week, in
                    bilateral meetings that observers hope will raise the bar on ambitions ahead of UN-sponsored climate
                    talks in late 2023.
                    <br>
                    The talks follow two other high-level U.S. visits to China this year, as the world’s largest
                    greenhouse gas emitters work to stabilize a relationship strained by trade disputes, military
                    tensions and accusations of spying.
                    <br>
                    John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy on climate change, will join bilateral talks with his Chinese
                    counterpart Xie Zhenhua in Beijing from July 16-19 that will focus on issues including reducing
                    methane emissions, limiting coal use, curbing deforestation and helping poor countries address
                    climate change.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The pair, who have cultivated a warm relationship over more than two decades of diplomacy, will also
                    likely discuss China’s objections to U.S. tariffs and other restrictions on imports of Chinese solar
                    panel and battery components, observers say.

                <p>A day after one person died in a bloody fight at yoga guru Ramdev’s Patanjali Food and Herbal Park,
                    the district administration has deployed police inside the campus to prevent another violent clash
                    at Haridwar’s Padartha village.
                    <br>
                    Police are investigating the matter after lodging an FIR under sections 302, 307, 147, 148, 149, 504
                    of the IPC.
                    <br>
                    Three persons, including Ramdev’s brother Ram Bharat, have been named as accused in the case.

                    “We will undertake search operations again to collect evidence from the food park,” Haridwar SSP
                    Sweety Agrawal told The Indian Express.

                    <br>
                    “Two others named in the case are Yogesh and Anand Goswami,” she said.
                    <br>
                    The autopsy report revealed that Daljeet, a local transporter involved in the clash, died due to
                    injuries after being beaten up.

                    Local transporters were protesting an alleged move by the food park management to deny them
                    assignments to transport products from the park to different parts of the country.

                <p>“You know what the tragedy of our Punjab is?” sub-inspector Balbir Singh drunkenly asks his rookie
                    partner Garundi in one scene. The two police officers, played by Suvinder Vicky and Barun Sobti,
                    often get together for a series of soul-baring sessions over late night drinks in Netflix’s new
                    crime drama, Kohrra. These are the show’s best scenes, devoted entirely to developing character and
                    little else. When Singh rues the state of Punjab, he doesn’t wait for Garundi to answer. “It’s our
                    ‘mitti pao’ attitude,” he says, finally expressing the guilt that he feels for having served a
                    corrupt system for so many years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We often complain about how the crime genre is handled in mainstream Hindi-language cinema. Far too
                    frequently, audiences are subjected to scenes of empty violence, or plot-heavy stories populated by
                    cardboard cut-outs and not real people. Singh’s sentiment is directed at corrupt superiors who, in
                    his opinion, have left Punjab in drug-fuelled, crime-infested disarray.

                <p>A U.S. appeals court on Friday rejected the Federal Trade Commission’s request to pause Microsoft’s
                    $69 billion purchase of “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The decision removes one of the few remaining hurdles stopping Xbox maker Microsoft from closing the
                    deal and expanding its gaming business.
                    <br>
                    The FTC had also asked Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the U.S. District Court in northern
                    California for a similar stay but she rejected that request late on Thursday.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The FTC did not immediately return a request for comment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Microsoft President Brad Smith said: “We appreciate the Ninth Circuit’s swift response denying the
                    FTC’s motion to further delay the deal. This brings us another step closer to the finish line in
                    this marathon of global regulatory reviews.”
                    <br>
                    The deal, the largest in the history of the videogame industry, still needs to be approved in
                    Britain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now that its latest appeal has been rejected, the FTC may drop the fight, as it has in similar
                    situations in the past. This happened most recently in February with Meta Platforms’ purchase of
                    virtual reality content maker Within Unlimited. The FTC lost in federal court and dropped the
                    challenge.
                    <br>
                    The merger agreement between Microsoft and Activision will expire on July 18. After July 18, either
                    company will be free to walk away from the deal unless they negotiate an extension.

                <p>Among the four candidates in the country to have topped six subjects in CUET this year, the
                    18-year-old aims to pursue BA (Hons) Political Science.
                    <br>
                    When it comes to CUET preparation strategy, Agrawal started right after her Class 12 Board exams in
                    which she scored 99 per cent. “I had no time to waste. As soon as I was done with my Board exams, I
                    started preparing for CUET UG. The syllabus was the same and the NTA (National Testing Agency) was
                    very clear that all the questions would be NCERT-based, so I started studying from NCERT. And I
                    think that is what helped me the most,” she tells The Indian Express.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The seven subjects that Agrawal appeared for were English, Economics, Fine Arts/Visual
                    Arts/Commercial Art, Geography/Geology, History, Political Science and General Test. She scored 100
                    percentile in all but the General Test, in which she attained a 99.91 percentile score.
                    <br>
                    Besides early preparation, what helped Agrawal was appearing for mock tests. “I maintained a
                    register in which I noted the days remaining till the exam date on one side, and the subjects on the
                    other. I planned my preparation strategy according to that and started solving one mock test for
                    each subject every day,” she says, adding she solved “nearly 100 mock tests in a month”.

                <p>India’s online gaming start-ups that offer fantasy and real-money games have written to the government urging it to reconsider the recent decision to impose a 28 per cent Goods and Service Tax (GST) on the full face value of pool deposit. They said that the decision has left the industry in “significant distress” and could have “devastating implications” for the companies, including a shut down of businesses.

                    Taxing online gaming to the point of “unviability,” contradicts the Prime Minister’s vision to be a leader in the online gaming space, the letter, which was signed by Mobile Premier League, Winzo, and industry associations representing companies like Dream11, among others said.

                    The development follows the GST Council’s decision to levy a uniform 28 per cent tax on full face value for online gaming, casinos and horse-racing. The government is expected to bring in a legal amendment to facilitate this in the monsoon session of Parliament, which will enable inclusion of online gaming and horse racing under actionable claim and hence, facilitate taxation of these categories with no distinction for game of skill or chance.

                <p>The top legal minds of the Congress met on Saturday to discuss the issue of <strong>Uniform Civil
                        Code</strong> and
                    are learnt to have decided to advise the party leadership to take a nuanced position on the matter
                    and declare the party’s stand only after perusing the draft Bill in the event of the government
                    bringing such a legislation in Parliament.
                    <br>
                    Senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram, Salman Khurshid, Abhishek Singhvi, Vivek Tankha, Manish
                    Tewari and K T S Tulsi met and discussed the legal and social aspects of UCC for over one and a half
                    hours. The informal panel will give a report to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sources said the leaders were of the view that the party should take a “nuanced” view on UCC as the
                    issue is layered and complex. The BJP, the leaders felt, would want the Congress to spell out a
                    position in favour or against the UCC, but the party will have to factor in various aspects before
                    taking a position.
                    <br>
                    The Congress had earlier this month decided to wait for the BJP government to take the next step on
                    UCC and come out with a draft Bill. It had refrained from “rushing in” with its opposition to the
                    idea in the absence of a Bill. The leaders who attended the meeting said the party was opposed to
                    the idea of uniformity and viewed UCC as “an assault on diversity”.

                <p>Jasprit Bumrah who could shape Team India’s campaign at the upcoming 50-over World Cup, is close to
                    regaining full-fitness and is in line to tour with the Indian white-ball team for the T20Is in
                    Ireland next month. The pacer, who is currently training at the National Cricket Academy in
                    Bengaluru, has been gradually increasing his workload and so is Shreyas Iyer, who has resumed
                    batting.

                    <br>
                    Bumrah, who underwent a back surgery in March, had resumed bowling last month after successfully
                    undergoing rehabilitation at the NCA. His rehab programme has been continuing under the watchful
                    eyes of BCCI’s head of cricket VVS Laxman, and he is bowling full throttle at the nets, where he is
                    sending down 8-10 overs.
                    <br>
                    While the selectors and the team management were looking to include Bumrah for the Asia Cup in
                    September, the progression he has made in the last couple of weeks means he could travel to Ireland
                    next month with a second-string India team. It is understood that a decision on this would be taken
                    in the coming days.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With no competitive cricket behind his back since last September, and given the nature of injury he
                    suffered, he is being handled with extra care. It is learnt that Bumrah isn’t showing any discomfort
                    at the nets, where he is training on a daily basis. There are indications that Bumrah could even
                    play a few practice matches at the NCA, where camps are underway.

                    the look and feel of it, could eliminate discomfort, embrace their bodies and help them to
                    confidently pursue their fitness goals. But with so many options out there, how do you find the

                <h3>Why do you need a sports bra? What’s the science behind it?</h3>
                You need one so that your breasts are supported and the back doesn’t hurt while exercising. It
                decreases breast discomfort and allows you to have a full range of motion during exercise. Without a
                sports bra, strength training and cardio-based exercises could turn cumbersome, especially if you
                have heavier breasts. If not supported, you could experience exercise-induced pain.

                <p>Fiber might just be the key to healthy weight management – and nature packages it in perfectly
                    balanced ratios with carbs when you eat them as whole foods.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Think unprocessed fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds. Research suggests that
                    carbohydrates are meant to come packaged in nature-balanced ratios of total carbohydrates to fiber.
                    In fact, certain types of fiber affect how completely your body absorbs carbohydrates and tells your
                    cells how to process them once they are absorbed.
                    <br>
                    Fiber slows the absorption of sugar in your gut. It also orchestrates the fundamental biology that
                    recent blockbuster weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic tap into, but in a natural way. Your
                    microbiome transforms fiber into signals that stimulate the gut hormones that are the natural forms
                    of these drugs. These in turn regulate how rapidly your stomach empties, how tightly your blood
                    sugar levels are controlled and even how hungry you feel.

                <p>Despite economic constraints, India emerges as the country with the second most confident travellers,
                    according to hotel and travel booking platform, Booking.com. The platform released its 2023 edition
                    of the APAC Travel Confidence Index (TCI), which offers insights into the mindsets of APAC
                    (Asia-Pacific) travellers and the deep impact of global uncertainties on their travel decisions.

                    Of the 11 APAC markets surveyed, India is the second most confident, behind Hong Kong and followed
                    by China, Singapore, and Taiwan.

                    Complex global challenges, including inflation, geopolitical instability, climate change, and supply
                    chain disruptions, have impacted travel. However, this year’s research unveils a striking paradox:
                    86% of Indian travellers are brimming with optimism about their future travel plans, while 61% have
                    no intention of delaying their travel plans in the next 12 months.
